=head1 NAME

DNSCheck::Test::Connectivity - Test zone connectivity

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test connectivity for a zone's nameservers. The following tests are made:

=over 4

=item *
A name server should not be announced by more than one AS.

=item *
A name server must be announced.

=item *
Domain name servers should live in more than one AS.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item ->test($zonename);

=item ->test_v4($zonename)

Test specifically for IPv4.

=item ->test_v6($zonename)

Test specifically for IPv6.
